            These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your

            bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use
            the services.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of digital

          <h2>3. Plans and Payment</h2>
          <p>
            Paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis
            (monthly or yearly) through our payment processors (Stripe
            and/or Lemon Squeezy). Prices, features, and billing cycles
            are described on the pricing page at the time of purchase.
            Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions automatically renew
            at the then-current rate until canceled.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            You may cancel your subscription at any time from your
            account settings; cancellation takes effect at the end of
            the current billing period and we do not pro-rate refunds
            for partial periods. If you experience a chargeback or
            dispute, please contact us first &mdash; we will do our best
            to resolve the issue.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>

            applicable law or third-party right; (b) upload malicious
            content or attempt to disrupt the services; (c) reverse
            engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source
            code from the services except as permitted by law; or (d)
            resell or sublicense access to the services without our
            written permission.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The services, including all underlying software, designs, and
            content, are owned by us or our licensors and are protected

          <h2>7. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the services at
            any time, with or without cause, with notice. Upon
            termination, your right to use the services ceases

          <h2>8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            The services are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and

            express or implied, including warranties of merchantability,
            fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. To
            the maximum extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability
            arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed
            the amounts you paid us in the twelve (12) months preceding
            the event giving rise to the liability.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in
            which our company is registered, without regard to
            conflict-of-laws principles. Any dispute will be resolved
            exclusively in the courts located in that jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. The &ldquo;Last
            updated&rdquo; date above will reflect the date of the most
            recent change. Continued use of the services after changes
            take effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised
            Terms.
