            This Privacy Policy describes how the operators of this
            website (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or
            &ldquo;our&rdquo;) collect, use, and protect information when
            you visit or use our services.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            When you create an account, sign up for a paid plan, or
            contact us, we collect information you provide directly, such
            as your name, email address, billing address, and payment
            information processed by our payment providers (Stripe, Lemon
            Squeezy). We also collect standard server logs (IP address,
            user agent, pages viewed) and use cookies and similar
            technologies for authentication and analytics.
          </p>

          <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use the information we collect to: provide, maintain, and
            improve our services; process payments and prevent fraud; send
            transactional emails (receipts, account notifications,
            security alerts); and respond to support requests.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal information. We share data only
            with vetted sub-processors who help us operate the service,
            including: payment processors (Stripe, Lemon Squeezy),
            database hosting (managed Postgres), email delivery
            (Mailgun), and error monitoring. Each sub-processor is
            contractually obligated to protect your data.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain account data for as long as your account is active.
            We delete personal data on request, except where retention is
            required for legal, tax, or accounting purposes.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your jurisdiction (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, etc.) you
            may have the right to access, correct, port, or delete the
            personal data we hold about you. Contact us at the address
            below to exercise these rights.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use industry-standard measures (TLS in transit, encryption
            at rest, row-level security in the database, webhook
            signature verification) to protect your data. No method of
            transmission over the Internet, however, is 100% secure.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Children</h2>
          <p>
            Our services are not directed to children under 13 (or under
            16 in the EEA / UK), and we do not knowingly collect personal
            data from them.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will
            notify you of material changes by email or by posting a
            notice on our site before the change takes effect.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Contact</h2>
          <p>
            If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our
            practices, please contact us at the email address listed on
            our home page.
